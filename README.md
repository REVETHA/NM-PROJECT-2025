This project uses deep learning to recognize handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is trained on the MNIST dataset for accurate digit classification. The model learns directly from image data, enabling robust digit recognition across various handwriting styles. It achieves high accuracy and can be integrated into real-world applications like smart forms or healthcare systems. Future scope includes expanding to letters and real-time recognition.
